# TIS-Assignment-2
Poster
Reflection
  What the assignment was about?
    This assignment was based on an industrial talk by PPG, a global coatings company. The poster      summarizes PPG's business segments, digital infrastructure, data analytics initiatives, SAP        operations and future IT trends discussed during the talk.
  What I learned?
    From this industrial talk, I learned how information technology supports large-scale busniess      operations. I gained understanding of how data analytics transforms raw data into predictive       insights, how could infrastructure enables global operations and how SAP systems manage key        business processes such as Procure-to-Pay and Order-to-Cash.
  Skilld developed
    Analytical skills – understanding business processes and IT integration.
    Technical awareness – exposure to cloud platforms, SAP, data analytics, and cybersecurity.
    Information summarization – converting complex industrial information into a clear poster          format.
    Visual communication – presenting technical content in a structured and readable design.
  Problems faced
    One challenge was understanding technical terms such as data analytics COE, SAP S/4HANA            migration, and zero-trust security. Another difficulty was organizing a large amount of            information into a single poster without overcrowding it.
  Suggestions for improvement
    The talk could be improved by including more real-life examples or demonstrations of the           systems used. More time for questions and explanations of technical terms would also help          students with limited industry exposure better understand the content.
